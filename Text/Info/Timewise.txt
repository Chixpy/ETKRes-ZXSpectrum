Time Wise
~~~~~~~~~

The world is at peace, a very unstable peace non the less.

Over the past hundred years, the United States / Soviet arms race has escalated to awesome proportions and the survival of the human race seems balanced on a knife edge.

A couple of weeks ago came the rumours, and then two days ago came the headlines in all the newspapers.

TERRORIST 'MILE HIGH BOMB' THREAT

'It was revealed yesterday that an as yet unnamed Middle Eastern terrorist organisation has created the world biggest atomic weapon, and will unleash this weapon, cracking the planet to its very core, unless thier demands are not met.'

Such a device, if detonated, would cause a chain reaction ripping the Earth apart, and such would be the destructive power of this explosion that not even the moon colonies would survive. The whole human race faces extintion.

Yesterday you took your plan to the government. You would use the highly expereimental TDU (Time Displacement Unit) that you have been working on in sectret for the defence department and travel back in time to the start of the 20th Century.

If Einstein was prevented from discovering the theory of relativity or releasing it to the public then history would be changed and there would be no atomic weaponry and this threat would not exist.

The military and government refuse, saying the peace we have cannot be ensured without the ultimate deterrant and they cannot lose thier nuclear weapon stockpiles.

You are taken from your secret base outside the city and imprisoned while the emergency is over.

You decide that too much is at stake and this is the only way to save the humanity. This prison cell cannot hold you, you need to get out of here, steal some uranium to fuel your time machine and get back to the hidden base.

You will go anyway...
