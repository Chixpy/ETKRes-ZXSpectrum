Andres Night off is a Basic program written by
Matthew Smith which appeared in the June 1984
issue of Computer and Video Games. Here's the
blurb which went with the listing
(fantastic bit of writing, this) :

 
"By now, most of you will have played or seen
Matthew Smith's latest weird and wonderful
Miner Willy epic from Software Projects, called
Jet Set Willy. But did you know that Matthew
had an idea which didn't quite make it into the
final version of that number one hit game for the
Spectrum? We bet you didn't!
     Well, Computer and Video games persuaded
our Golden Joystick Award winner, Matthew, to
give us an exclusive listing of the missing
screen. And now we're passing it on to you -
just for the price of this magazine. You can't say
we're not generous! Matthew has been slaving
away for a couple of weeks to get this game to
you - we hope you like it!
      As you already know, Miner Willy has been
spending the cash he made down the mine and 
has purchased a vast mansion - complete with
a housekeeper and a cook. Maria, the
housekeeper, gives Willy a hard time about the
mess his guests leave behind after a mammoth
party in Jet Set Willy.
      In our game, Andre the cook has waltzed off
for the evening without leaving so much as a
boiled egg for Willy to munch on! Anyway, our
hero marches down to the kitchen to make
himself a sandwich and comes face to face with
the amazing technicolour man-eating pizzas!
GASP!
      Can you survive the onslaught of these nasty
little doughy monsters? Dare you open Willys'
kitchen door? Full instructions are included in
Matthews listing - let us know if you like it!"
