THE STORY:
Earth's destiny lies in the balance. Rumours has it that mad scientists 
are developing a new weapon so dangerous it makes the a-bomb look like a 
firecracker. Reliable sources confirms that it's got something to do with 
Miner Willy's DNA, some radioactive components and a fairly large sausage. 
Eugene, the most evil being in the galaxy, ain't to happy with people who 
go out and do evil stuff without letting him in on it, so he has decided 
to find out what's going on, kill the bastards responsible and possibly 
destroy the entire universe. Well, that's what happens when one writes the
plot after the game's all done... But then again, we all know that Manic 
Miner games don't have to rely on sophisticated plots. It's all about 
the thrill of jumping up and down... 
So, take Eugene (That toilet drinking, four eyed bugger from Manic Miner 
part one) and guide him through 16 levels of unspeakable 48Kb glory!


INSTRUCTIONS:
       Q-P: Move left and right
Bottom row: Jump
       A-G: Pause


WHAT'S NEW?:
-16 Levels instead of 20. (Due to the compulsive act of including a
                           full-screen Sub-Zero... (5Kb!))
-No music (Made room for more code and gfx and room for a more 
           pleasant gaming experience...Sorry Matthew...)
-A Jet Pac-like interlude (Level 9)
-A huge animated mutant Manic Miner (16'th Cavern)
-New end of game sequence
-And a bunch of minor details not really worth mentioning...
