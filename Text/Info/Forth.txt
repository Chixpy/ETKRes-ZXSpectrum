	Spectrum Forth Installation instructions

Load the Forth compiler by:

LOAD "" CODE (CODE = extended mode I)

Stop the tape when it has loaded (or emulator equivalent for TZX files)

The Forth editor is next on the tape. To load it type the following:

	1 LOAD <ENTER>

The computer will respond with:  READY CASSETTE.

Pressing ENTER will initiate the cassette loading routine.

Start the tape and then press ENTER.  The first screen takes a few seconds
to load.  Stop the tape when the characteristic blue and yellow lines finish.
Wait for READY CASSETTE to appear and then start the tape and press ENTER.
There are a total of 3 screens to be loaded.
If the program does not load properly, re-wind tape to beginning of screen.
After the third screen has loaded, 'OK' will appear.

N.B. Don't be alarmed by an error MSG #4
Your editor is now loaded.

Now start programming in Forth.


	HAPPY PROGRAMMING & GOOD LUCK
