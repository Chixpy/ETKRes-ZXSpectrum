Final release+ version 1.1 (8th April 2000)
======================================================
'Willy Comes Home' (c) Gawp! 1999
======================================================
Cheers:
To Matthew Smith, 'nuff said.
To John Elliot, for his excellent "JSWed128".
To Andrew Broad, for his founding of the Yahoo Miner Willy / Jet Set Willy Club.
To the people who wrote the ZX32 Emulator, as I don't have a REAL speccy.
===============================================================================
This is my first JSW game. It was designed using the 128k editor by John Elliot. 
I'm not really a 'programmer' - I just use the editors to the best of my ability, 
and try to get the best out of their confines.
John's editor is the easiest to use of all the editors I've tried so far. 
You can have teleporters and up to 256 rooms.('Willy Comes Home' has about 160).

The idea with this version is "Willy returning (again) to his mansion - 
but only to find that most of it has changed, or seems to be falling down! 
On further investigation Willy realises that someone/thing 
has/have been using his house for their own evil deeds. 
Maria seems to be in hiding somewhere down below, 
and strange lights have been spotted in the night sky... 
maybe it's the builders, maybe it's something else..."

ENJOY !

let mw know what you think.... (see email/web address below)

============
Anyway, it should be done in the next month or so. 
Work has slowed recently due to the birth of my first child .
I've just got to finish the sprites (it still uses mostly the originals, 
and some of Richard Hallas' from JTJS) and a few rooms, and then test it...

Cheers for now...
Gawp.

I have just downloaded and played around your new beta version of Willy comes Home!
It's a nice piece of work, even if it's sheer size makes it still a bit difficult to finish.
I love the new sprites, specially Willy's "rebel" hairstyle.
