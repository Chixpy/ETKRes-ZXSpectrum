JET SET WILLY 2 128K  - THE FINAL FRONTIER (Fixed 128K version)

*************************************************************************
**  Jet Set Willy 2 - Fixed version. This version has been altered     **
**  by James McKay so that when Willy loses a life, he is then         **
**  invulnerable for three seconds, which prevents Willy from getting  **
**  caught in a no-win infinite loop.                                  **
**                                                                     **
**  Also, James has added a feature to this version, whereby when you  **
**  are playing, you can press the [T] key, and a menu will appear.    **
**  From this menu you can select from a variety of cheats, such as    **
**  Infinite Lives and so forth, and also select the number of any     **
**  room you wish to be 'teleported' to.                               **
**                                                                     **
**  Please note: In order to fit the fix, the cheats and the teleport  **
**  routines into JSW2, it was necessary to convert JSW2 to a 128K     **
**  program. There are no new screens or anything, this is merely the  **
**  48K game in 128K with the above additions.                         **
**                                                                     **

DESCRIPTION
A multi screen platform game.  Jet Set Willy 2 is a near
identical copy of Jet Set Willy 1, but with more rooms and
slightly different colours.

AIM : Same as the original JSW, but more of it... Willy has had
 another colossal party and (yes) Maria has gone on strike again. He
 cannot get to bed until he collects all the glasses for a second
 time...

  This time round, however, Willy's mansion is "bigger and better". If
 you are lucky, you too will visit "The Final Frontier" and see the
 rather odd sight of Willy in a space suit.

 GAMEPLAY : Collect all the glasses, jump from platform to platform
 and avoid the nasties. That's it, basically.

 COMMENTS : "Very good... but not much progress."
 RATING : 61% (CRASH #19, August 1985)

CONTROLS
Q E T U O         - Left
W R Y I P         - Right
<Caps> - <Space>  - Jump

Also;

H J K L <ENTER>   - Music on/off
A S D F G         - Pause game

INSTRUCTIONS
Using the keys, the aim is to collect all of the flashing objects
and then make your way back to The Master Bedroom.

CHEATS
The poke is: 7543,FF or 7A16,C3 (does the same).  In JSW2 the
player has in the beginning 8 lives.  The lives are stored in a
interesting way I have seen that somewhere before (may be too a
M.Smith game).  As a byte has 8 bits, it's used here.  When you
fill a memory address with 11111110b and then everytime when
loosing a life you shift the byte left through CARRY, the 8th
time you get in CARRY flag 0.  1111110b = FEh, if you write FFh
instead, you never get 0 in CY.  The second way is to make the
conditional jump unconditional, instead of JP C,XX can be used
JP XX. That's the second poke.

Poke 31254,195 lives
30019,255      Infinite lives.
31224,201      Invulnerability
32261,201      Monsters harmless
34686,n        Objects to collect (1-174)
30027,n        Start room number (0-134)
31657,n        Max monsters per room (1-15)


SEQUELS/PREQUELS
Jet Set Willy 2 is the sequel to Jet Set Willy 1, and is
basically just a bigger version.  There are many other versions
floating about, most of them hacked versions of this game and the
original.

INLAY CARD TEXT

Whilst recovering in hospital from a severe fall down some stairs,
Willy called in the builders. He thought it odd that they had green
skin, but needing the work done in a hurry he asked them to remove
the offending edges from his stairs. Trouble was, they did far more
work than asked, adding several rooms to his mansion and then
refusing to charge him!! 

Maria is demanding that Willy clears up the mess and he hasn't even
found all the rooms yet. Who were these strange people? Why did they
need to add a Rocket Room to Willy's already substantial house? 

Much patience and stamina is required to explore the extended house
and NASA's "Guide to Simple Space Travel" is recommended reading for
those foolhardy enough to help Willy clear up the mess. Be careful
in the sewers and watch out for the bell ringer in the Belfry!!

Good Luck!!

GENERAL FACTS
JetSet Willy was converted to the Amstrad CPC range of computers
in 1985.  During the translation, it gained a few new rooms, (a
mere 76!) and Software Projects deemed it worthy to translate
*back* to the Spectrum.  This they did...  The story this time
is that Willy fell down the stairs, and whilst recovering in
hospital, called in the builders to take off all the sharp edges
on the stairway.  They did far more than this...  Willy thought
it odd that they had green skin, but needed the work done
quickly, so thought no more about it.  The NASA guide to easy
Space travel is recommended for playing this game!
  
JSW2 has 134 rooms, which fill out the gaps in the original map,
a room which is supposed to be only accessable by cheating, a
real deserted isle, 175 objects (don't panic - you only need to
collect 150 of them!) and no Attic Bug.
  
To find out why Willy needs a Space suit, you'd better take a
look at the Watch Tower, and there's a surprise new ending too!
There's also the final room - "Oh $#!+ - The Central Cavern!"
which is a playable room, but inaccessable.

What's the function of "Trip Switch"?  Go into the room Trip
Switch and jump at the switch in the top left-hand corner.  A
message will appear at the top of the screen saying 'Trip Switch
On'. It will remain on until you lose a life (and you will, you
will).  The idea is to navigate all thirty-odd rooms between
there and the Yacht (or maybe the Bow); when you get there, the
yacht should start moving and dump you on the Deserted Isle.
Here, you collect the object and walk/jump about a bit (I can't
remember exactly what) until a counter appears saying 'Time to
rescue 999'. When this reaches 000, the right-hand tree will
fall. Walk to the right; before you reach the water you will be 
teleported to the Teleport room (the one with four platforms in
an X).  The reason for this was a hoax in Your Spectrum issue 7
claiming that  you could do this with the boat in the original
Jet Set Willy.

(Deserted Isle came about from a joke letter being printed in
CRASH, stating that if you waited on "The Bow" until Midnight,
a raft floated on-screen, and took you to a screen called "Secret
Isle"  The catch [apart from it not existing!] was that JSW
paused after a minute if you didn't press a key.  I got round
this by leaving a book pressed on a jump key!

The room 'cheat' can only be reached by cheating, hence the name;
it lies between the Bow and the Deserted Isle, and if you cheat
to walk on water, you don't need to go through the rigmarole
described above.

It's not only possible to enter the room "Secret Passage", it's
necessary to go there to get the objects in the Hole With No
Name.  Jump against the top right-hand part of the wall in "The
Hole With No Name".  This should let you enter the Secret Passage
from the left-hand side. Walk through it; you will appear on the
left-hand side on the HWNN (honestly) and can collect the objects
there.  I think you then have to go back the other way.

Is it possible to get into " Star Drive - The Early Brick Version
" WITHOUT killing yourself walking across a machine in " Banned
"?  Yes - But only just...  You need to be pixel-perfect!  Stand
on the very edge of the furthermost right section of the funny
"S" shaped walk-through blocks.  As the periscope comes towards
you, jump at and over it.  You only have two pixels of free space
to play with - so you need to be damn sharp on the keyboard!

JSW2 also plays "Moonlight Sonata" in attract mode, (for want of
a better phrase) and plays Edward Grieg's (1843-1907) "The Hall 
of the mountain king" as in-game music.

NOTES
'Dumb waiter' and 'Macaroni Ted';  Those two were in-jokes at the
time.  Just as in Manic Miner, MS had a go at Eugene Evans with
'Eugenes Lair', Derrick had another go at him with Dumb Waiter. 
Eugene also wrote a game called 'Wacky Waiters' for the Vic20. 
(In 1983!) It was dire, to say the least...  And Macaroni Ted was
a go at the two blokes who wrote Technician Ted.  They worked for
the electronics firm Marconi...
